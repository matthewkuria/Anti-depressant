        <h2>What is  <span>depression?</span></h2>
        <p>Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time.

          Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.
          
          Depression can happen to anyone. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression. Women are more likely to have depression than men.</p>
        <p>So basically we've all heard about depression and we all have a definition of what depression is but do we really know what depression is?</p>
        <p>Most people tend to relate to depression by self injuries,boredorm and to some extent suicide.To some level all this are right but depression is more than just that
          and can be caused by a lot of things.Firstly before we even get to state them one needs to take depression just like any other disease and in the world <b><i>280 million</i></b>
          people suffer from depression and Kenya contributes to that figure with a staggering 1.9 million individuals.
        </p>
        <h3>Symptoms - Depression in adults</h3>
        <p>The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy.

          The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life.
          
          There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page.</p>
          <h5>Psychological symptoms</h5>
          <ol>
            The psychological symptoms of depression include:
            
           <li> continuous low mood or sadness</li>
            <li>having low self-esteem</li>
            <li>having low self-esteem</li>
            <li>feeling tearful</li>
           <li> feeling guilt-ridden</li>
           <li> feeling irritable and intolerant of others</li>
            <li>having no motivation or interest in things</li>
           <li> finding it difficult to make decisions</li>
            <li>not getting any enjoyment out of life</li>
            <li>feeling anxious or worried</li>
           <li> having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself</li>
          </ol>
        <a href="blog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h5>How to treat and fight depression</h5></a>
      
        <p>
          There are effective treatments for depression. These include psychological treatment and medications. Seek care if you have symptoms of depression.
          
          Psychological treatments are the first treatments for depression. They can be combined with antidepressant medications in moderate and severe depression. Antidepressant medications are not needed for mild depression.
          
          Psychological treatments can teach new ways of thinking, coping or relating to others. They may include talk therapy with professionals and supervised lay therapists. Talk therapy can happen in person or online. Psychological treatments may be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. 
          
          Effective psychological treatments for depression include: 
          <ol>
            <li>behavioural activation</li>
            <li>cognitive behavioural therapy</li>
            <li>interpersonal psychotherapy</li>
            <li> problem-solving therapy.</li>
          </ol>       
        
          Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine.
          
          Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences.
          
          Antidepressants should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with extra caution.
          
          Different medications and treatments are used for bipolar disorder.</p>
          <h5>What are the four types of depression?</h5>
          <p>
            The four most common types of depression are
         <strong>
          <ol>
            <li>major depression,</li>
            <li>persistent depressive disorder,</li>
            <li>bipolar disorder and</li>
            <li> seasonal affective disorder.</li>
          </ol>  
         </strong>
            
          <strong>  Major depression:</strong> Major depression is a constant and overwhelming feeling of being sad. People lose interest in daily living activities such as grooming, bathing and eating. Even those activities that once pleased them (such as exercising, reading, gardening and being with their partner) now seem worthless and daunting. There may be days when they do not get out of bed. They may have trouble sleeping, crying spells, changes in appetite or weight, loss of energy and feel worthless. In extreme cases, they may have thoughts of death or suicide. Major depression is a serious mental health issue that needs timely treatment and empathy from family and coworkers. What is the main cause of major depression? It’s different for everyone and it may be due to a combination of causes. It can be successfully treated with psychotherapy and medications. For some people with severe depression, medications do not work. In such cases, electroconvulsive therapy may be effective.
            <br><br><strong>Bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disease):</strong> Individuals with this condition have alternate episodes of depression followed by periods of unusually high energy or activity. Manic symptoms look like the opposite of depression symptoms—individuals may have grandiose ideas, unrealistically high self-esteem, decreased need for sleep and an accelerated pursuit of pleasure including pumped-up sex drive, spending sprees and risk-taking behavior such as gambling or overspeeding. The manic stage often leads to self-destructive behavior and is followed by a period of depression. It is managed by psychotherapy and drugs called mood stabilizers.
            <br><br><strong>Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia):</strong> This type of depression refers to a low mood that has lasted for at least two years, but it does not reach the intensity of major depression. People with dysthymia are often able to function in day-to-day life, but they feel low or joyless (anhedonic) most of the time. Other depressive symptoms of dysthymia may include appetite and sleep changes, low energy, low self-esteem or hopelessness.
            <br><br><strong>Seasonal affective disorder:</strong> This type of depression has been linked to reduced sunlight exposure. Reduced sunlight exposure affects the biological rhythm and causes an imbalance in the levels of certain chemical messengers in the brain (serotonin and melatonin). Seasonal affective disorder emerges as days get shorter in fall and winter. Symptoms remain the same as seen in other types of depression. Treatment is light therapy, involving daily sessions of sitting close to an especially intense light source for a recommended amount of time.</p>
